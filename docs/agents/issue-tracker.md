# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this package live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file
- Comments append under a `## Comments` heading

## Wayfinding operations

- Map: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md`
- Child tickets: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`
- Tickets use `Type:` and `Status:` lines
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
